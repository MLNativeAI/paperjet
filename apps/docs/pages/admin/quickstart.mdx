</Steps>

## Hardware requirements

We recommend a minimum of 2 vCPU and 4gb of RAM.

Both x86 and ARM based systems are supported.

## Docker compose

Docker compose is the easiest way to set up PaperJet on any environment.

### One-liner setup

Run these commands to deploy PaperJet instantly:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLNativeAI/paperjet/main/apps/docs/deployment/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

This will download the complete production setup and start all services in the background.

## Configuration

Coming soon. The docker-compose is pre-configured to just start out of the box

## Model providers

### vLLM

VLLM is the recommended platform for running AI models.

### LM Studio

Currently not supported due to [a bug with structured outputs](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-bug-tracker/issues/189)
